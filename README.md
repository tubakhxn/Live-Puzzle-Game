## About This Project
This project is a real-time puzzle game that uses your webcam and hand tracking to let you play a sliding puzzle with your own live image. It combines computer vision (OpenCV), hand detection (MediaPipe), and a fun interactive UI.

- **How it works:**
	- The camera captures your image.
	- You use hand gestures to capture and interact with the puzzle.
	- The puzzle is created from your own live video feed.
	- Solve the puzzle by dragging and swapping pieces!

Great for demos, computer vision learning, and just having fun with AI and puzzles.
